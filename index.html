           <h2>Me</h2>
           <p>I am a non-binary spirit strolling through life by encompassing visual experiences and threading them into stories, films, and analogue photographs.
           I strive for connection and evolution, change and exploration.
           When I create art, I enable myself and others to go deeper into the human experience.
           I don't know how not to do that, that's how I know I'm on the right path.</p>

           <h2>My Hobby</h2>
           <p>I am mostly interested in analogue photography because it offer a more interesting process. It is less goal oriented and because of it's nature itself, it helps me with the immersion. It is abstract yet grounding at the same time.</p>

    <div class="me_container" id="photography">
           <h2>Film Photography</h2>
           <p>Analog photography, also known as film photography, is a catch-all term for photography that uses chemical processes to capture an image, typically on paper, film or a hard plate. These analog processes were the only methods available to photographers for more than a century prior to the invention of digital photography, which uses electronic sensors to record images to digital media.</p>
